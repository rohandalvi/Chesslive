A beautiful online chess play web app. 

Lets see how far this project gets built. At one point I plan to make this code open source but let's keep it private for now..

Structure:

1. Game (make it super fast, very lite)
  a. play
  b. observe
2. User Management
3. Security (mostly handled by firebase)
4. Single channel chat (as a side-app)
5. Help
