A beautiful online chess play web app.

Lets see how far this project gets built. At one point I plan to make this code open source but let's keep it private for now..

Structure:

1. Game (make it super fast, very lite)
  a. play
  b. observe
2. User Management
3. Security (mostly handled by firebase)
4. Single channel chat (as a side-app)
5. Help

Accomplished so far:

1. Setup node environment and build setup (Jenkins).
2. Wrote tests using mocha and setup code coverage using istanbul.
3. Initiated data layer to interact with Firebase.
4. Partially setup firebase schema to handle data.
5. Initiated React.js.
